/*
 * The following program contains 11 errors.  Find them all and correct the code
 * so that it compiles and runs successfully.  Some errors are obvious (e.g.,
 * misspelled keywords or missing punctuation); others are more subtle.
 *
 * Hints:
 * - Every public class should have a matching filename and an opening brace.
 * - The main method signature must be exactly:
 *       public static void main(String[] args)
 * - Java is case-sensitive; pay attention to capital letters in System.out.println.
 * - All strings printed with System.out.println must be surrounded by double quotes.
 * - Each statement needs a semicolon at the end.
 * - Parentheses and braces must be balanced.
